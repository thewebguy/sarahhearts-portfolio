							<h3>About</h3>
							<hr />
						
							<p>Hi! I'm Sarah Khandjian, but you can call me Sarah Hearts. I'm the daughter of a print expert and a graphic designer, and have always had a love for art and a strong passion for design. I followed my interests to Tallahassee, Florida, where I honed my skills at Florida State University. While there, I developed an affinity for color theory, print making, and Adobe Illustrator. I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in graphic design.</p>

							<p>I started Sarah Hearts in 2006 as a means to create handmade items and supplement my meager college income. I created handmade bags and screen printed apparel and sold them online and in the student union. A couple years later, I married my love, Kevin. We had a simple, handmade wedding for which I hand screen printed our stationery and made all the decorations. The wedding designing process sparked my interest in stationery design and then began creating wedding stationery for friends.</p>

							<p>I am now a freelance designer and create social stationery, logos and branding, apparel design, posters, and more. My work has been featured in Brides Magazine Florida, Brink Magazine, Interview Her and Weddings Illustrated. Recent clients include Summit Church and Owl City.</p>

							<p>I currently live in Winter Park, Florida. When I'm not creating things, I enjoy decorating our mid-century home and hanging out at the barn with my horse Justin and dog Darcy.</p>
